### 📝 Notes
1. this is not actuall testing process, it's only to visualize the testing step
2. as it not actuall test process so i donot use testing framework i built one called ("Ktest => Kareem test" like Gtest => Google test) 
3. Ktest has main functions common in testing (built on OOP)
4. i donot test all function i test libs functions , and another functtions manually tested
